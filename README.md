# Spudify
Spudify is an audio streaming platform inspired by Spotify.  Guests can browse content,  enjoy complementary access, and indulge in their favorite sounds.

To build Spudify, I used the following stack:
  * Ruby on Rails - web-application framework
  * Postgresql - database management
  * React - front-end rendering
  * Redux - state-management

Spudify was designed with modularity in mind.  By leveraging React component nesting, I was able to design a guest experience that is infinitely customizable.  Conditionally rendering components based on any number of factors, including a user’s signed-in status, means full control over touchpoints and allows for simple funnel testing and ultimately, enhanced conversions. Modularity has the added benefit of seemless site maintenance, and no service disruptions.
